# RappiBusinessCase
Rappi is a Latin American food and goods delivery company. The business case asks the question of whether they should implement a discount campaign/promotion where customers that rceive their deliveries in over 35 min will not have to pay for the full order value (food/good + shipping will be covered by Rappi).

I therefore create a statistical reasoning to decide which restaurants/stores were the most likely to have orders under 35 min and apply the promotion to those, since the chance of Rappi winning their side of the strategy is higher.
